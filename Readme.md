PDF Segmenter Application
This Java application segments a system-generated PDF into distinct sections based on the whitespace between blocks of text, making exactly X cuts. It identifies logical sections such as headings, paragraphs, and distinct blocks, purely by analyzing the structure of the document without using image processing.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:

Ensure that Java (version 8 or above) is installed.
Install Maven (if not already installed) to manage dependencies.
Download and include the Apache PDFBox library (version 2.0 or higher).
Dependencies: Add the following dependencies to your pom.xml file (for Maven):

xml
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.pdfbox</groupId>
    <artifactId>pdfbox</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.24</version>
</dependency>
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-segmenter.git
cd pdf-segmenter
Build the Project: To build the project, run:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
How to Run the Application
Command Line Usage:

Run the application by passing the file path of the PDF and the number of cuts (X) you wish to make.
bash
Copy code
java -jar target/pdf-segmenter.jar <pdf-file-path> <number-of-cuts>
Example:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/pdf-segmenter.jar sample.pdf 5
Output:

The application will output the segmented sections of the PDF into the console or store them in a file, depending on the implementation.
Each section will be labeled with the index of the cut and displayed as text.
Examples of Usage
Basic Example: Input: A PDF document with several logical sections (title, body paragraphs, bullet points).

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/pdf-segmenter.jar report.pdf 3
Output:

less
Copy code
Section 1:
- Title of Report

Section 2:
- Introduction and body paragraphs

Section 3:
- Conclusion and final remarks
Handling Whitespace: The application will analyze whitespace between text blocks and strategically make cuts. If fewer distinct sections exist than specified cuts (X), the program will attempt to balance cuts between existing sections.

Unit Tests
Unit tests ensure the proper segmentation of PDFs and handle various edge cases. Unit tests are written using JUnit to test different functionalities of the application, such as handling of different types of PDFs and ensuring cuts are made correctly based on whitespace.

Test Structure: The unit tests are included in the src/test/java directory and are automatically executed when running mvn test.

Example Unit Test:

java
Copy code
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class PDFSegmenterTest {

    @Test
    public void testExactCuts() throws IOException {
        // Mock or load a sample PDF document with well-defined sections
        File samplePdf = new File("src/test/resources/sample.pdf");
        int expectedCuts = 3;

        // Call the segmenter
        PDFSegmenter segmenter = new PDFSegmenter();
        List<String> sections = segmenter.segmentPDF(samplePdf, expectedCuts);

        // Verify the number of sections
        assertEquals(expectedCuts, sections.size());
    }

    @Test
    public void testWhitespaceHandling() throws IOException {
        // Test with a PDF that has large whitespace gaps
        File spacedPdf = new File("src/test/resources/spaced.pdf");
        int expectedSections = 4;

        PDFSegmenter segmenter = new PDFSegmenter();
        List<String> sections = segmenter.segmentPDF(spacedPdf, expectedSections);

        // Verify that the cuts match the whitespace gaps
        assertEquals(expectedSections, sections.size());
    }
}
Edge Cases:

Empty PDF: Ensure the application handles empty PDFs gracefully.
PDF with no whitespace: Test cases where the PDF has continuous text with no significant whitespace, ensuring that the application distributes cuts evenly.
More Cuts than Sections: Handle cases where the requested number of cuts (X) is greater than the number of logical sections available.
Run Unit Tests: To run the unit tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
